Overview
============

FileDialog Library consists of functions that wrap the COM implementation of the common item dialog used with IFileOpenDialog and IFileSaveDialog objects. Thus the FileDialog Library functions hide the complexities of interacting with the COM objects, and provide easy to use functions with support for both Ansi and Wide/Unicode.

The FileDialog library and source code are free to use for anyone, and anyone can contribute to the FileDialog Library project.
